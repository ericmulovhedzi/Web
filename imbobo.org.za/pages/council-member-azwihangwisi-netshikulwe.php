				<p style="text-align:justify;">
					After having such a long-standing relationship with both the founding members and directors of the parent company, OVH EV Company, and earning himself a BSocSc. Sociology (Hons & Masters) at the University of Cape Town, Mr. Azwihangwisi Netshikulwe saw it fit that it was only fair that the entity's leadership together with directors of Spider Black Holding, jointly collaborate with the purpose of setting up a sustainable Corporate Social Investment (CSI) initiative to contribute in improving the road safety coditions in and around road networks of the republic South Africa.
					<br /><br />
					He describes that while the country, in itself, has had its fair share of knock-on effetcs on its economic activity due to a wide range and variety of its socio-economic challanges, a great deal of a certain type of a technological corporate social responsibility program that is designed specifically in a form of an overarching approach or strategy for improving the social, environmental and economic well-being of the majority of the people in South African's diverse communities or societies at large is still imparative.
					<br /><br />
					Furthermore, he elaborates, this would require a multidisciplinary perspective, most probably social science (Sociology) and artificial intelligence (AI), to play a leading role in attempts to providing solutions to these socio-econmic ills.
					<br /><br />
					It was due to this conserted effort that <strong style='color:#897a1a;'>iMbobo App NPO</strong> was formed.
